                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate computer programmer with 6 years of programming experience. When I got a Raspberry PI for Christmas of 2018,
                     I was super excited. Looking back on it, I am grateful that I had the unique opportunity to learn computer programming by just
                      messing around and exploring the environment while making silly and sometimes complex projects. As my knowledge of computer
                       science has grown over the years I have gradually realized how crucial syntax, code structure, and careful planning gives you 
                       the ability to create anything you can imagine. What I find exciting about computer science is that there's always something new to learn. 
                       I'm looking forward to picking up more programming skills to improve my abilities.
